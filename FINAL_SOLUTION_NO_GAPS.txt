FINAL SOLUTION - No Gaps Between Overage Charge Lines

OPTION 1: Use the Loop (Recommended - Already Implemented)
Your template code is correct:
{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibits}}

CRITICAL: Set Paragraph Formatting in Word Template:
1. Open your template in Word
2. Find the overage charges section
3. Select the area where the template code is
4. Right-click → Paragraph
5. Set EXACTLY:
   - Spacing Before: 0 pt
   - Spacing After: 0 pt
   - Line spacing: Single
   - Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style: CHECKED ✓
6. Click OK
7. Save template

OPTION 2: Use Pre-formatted String (Alternative)
I've added code that generates a pre-formatted string. You can use this in your template:

{{overage_charges_formatted}}

This will output all overage charges as a single formatted string with line breaks but no paragraph spacing.

HOW IT WORKS:
- The code automatically generates: "Overage Charges for [Name]: $X per User | $Y per server per month | $Z per GB" for each exhibit
- Joins them with line breaks (\n) which creates new lines without paragraph spacing
- No gaps between lines

TESTING:
1. Use Option 1 (the loop) with paragraph spacing set to 0
2. OR use Option 2 (the pre-formatted string)
3. Generate a new agreement
4. Check the output - should have no gaps between lines
