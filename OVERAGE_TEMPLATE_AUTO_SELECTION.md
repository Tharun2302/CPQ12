# ✅ Overage Agreement - Template Auto-Selection Implementation

## 🎯 Requirement

When user selects "OVERAGE AGREEMENT" combination:
- ✅ Should auto-select the appropriate overage agreement template from database
- ✅ Works like other combinations (automatic template selection)
- ✅ Matches based on migration type (Messaging or Content)

---

## 📁 Template Files in Database

### Templates Seeded:

1. **OVERAGE AGREEMENT Messaging**
   - File: `overage-agreement.docx`
   - Category: `messaging`
   - Combination: `overage-agreement`
   - Plan Type: `overage`

2. **OVERAGE AGREEMENT Content**
   - File: `overage-agreement.docx`
   - Category: `content`
   - Combination: `overage-agreement`
   - Plan Type: `overage`

**Note**: Both use the SAME physical file (`overage-agreement.docx`) but are separate database entries for different migration types.

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### File Modified: `src/App.tsx`

Added special handling in the `autoSelectTemplateForPlan()` function:

```typescript
// Special handling for OVERAGE AGREEMENT - match by combination and category
if (combination === 'overage-agreement') {
  const overageMatches = templates.filter(t => {
    const templateCombination = (t?.combination || '').toLowerCase();
    const templateCategory = (t?.category || '').toLowerCase();
    const matchesCombination = templateCombination === 'overage-agreement';
    const matchesCategory = templateCategory === migration;
    
    console.log('🎯 Overage Agreement matching:', {
      templateName: t?.name,
      templateCombination,
      templateCategory,
      targetMigration: migration,
      matchesCombination,
      matchesCategory,
      finalMatch: matchesCombination && matchesCategory
    });
    
    return matchesCombination && matchesCategory;
  });
  
  if (overageMatches.length > 0) {
    console.log('✅ Found OVERAGE AGREEMENT template:', overageMatches[0].name);
    return overageMatches[0];
  }
}
```

### Matching Logic:

1. **Check if combination is 'overage-agreement'**
2. **Filter templates by**:
   - `combination` field = `'overage-agreement'`
   - `category` field = migration type (`'messaging'` or `'content'`)
3. **Return the first match** (there should be exactly one per migration type)

## 🔄 How It Works

### For Messaging Migration Type:

```
User Selection:
├── Migration Type: Messaging
├── Combination: OVERAGE AGREEMENT
├── (Fill configuration)
└── Click "Calculate Pricing"
    └── Click "Select" button

Auto-Selection Process:
├── combination = 'overage-agreement'
├── migration = 'messaging'
└── Matches template:
    ├── name: "OVERAGE AGREEMENT Messaging"
    ├── combination: 'overage-agreement' ✅
    ├── category: 'messaging' ✅
    └── SELECTED! ✅
```

### For Content Migration Type:

```
User Selection:
├── Migration Type: Content
├── Combination: OVERAGE AGREEMENT
├── (Fill configuration)
└── Click "Calculate Pricing"
    └── Click "Select" button

Auto-Selection Process:
├── combination = 'overage-agreement'
├── migration = 'content'
└── Matches template:
    ├── name: "OVERAGE AGREEMENT Content"
    ├── combination: 'overage-agreement' ✅
    ├── category: 'content' ✅
    └── SELECTED! ✅
```

## 📊 Template Matching Priority

The auto-selection logic now checks in this order:

1. **🥇 PRIORITY 1: Overage Agreement Special Check** (NEW!)
   - If combination = 'overage-agreement'
   - Match by: `combination` field AND `category` field
   - This runs FIRST, before other checks

2. **🥈 PRIORITY 2: PlanType + Combination Match**
   - Match by: `planType` field AND `combination` field
   - For normal combinations

3. **🥉 PRIORITY 3: Name-based Exact Match**
   - Match by: Template name patterns
   - Fallback for other combinations

4. **🏅 PRIORITY 4: Scoring System**
   - Score-based matching
   - Last resort fallback

---

## ✅ Updates Made

### 1. Special Overage Agreement Handler
```typescript
// Added at the START of autoSelectTemplateForPlan()
if (combination === 'overage-agreement') {
  // Match by combination + category
  // Returns immediately if found
}
```

### 2. Name-based Matching
```typescript
// Added overage agreement check
const isOverageAgreement = name.includes('overage') && name.includes('agreement');

// Added to combination checks
(combination === 'overage-agreement' && isOverageAgreement) ||
```

### 3. Scoring System
```typescript
// Added bonus points for overage agreement
if (combination === 'overage-agreement' && 
    name.includes('overage') && 
    name.includes('agreement')) {
  score += 5;
}
```

### 4. Logging
```typescript
// Added to debug logs
console.log('🎯 Overage Agreement matching:', {
  templateName: t?.name,
  templateCombination,
  templateCategory,
  targetMigration: migration,
  matchesCombination,
  matchesCategory,
  finalMatch: matchesCombination && matchesCategory
});
```
