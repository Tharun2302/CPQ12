FIXED TEMPLATE - No Gaps Between Lines

Use this EXACT code in your Word template:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibits}}

CRITICAL FORMATTING:
1. Put EVERYTHING on ONE line - no line breaks inside the loop
2. NO space before {{#exhibits}}
3. NO space after {{/exhibits}}
4. The entire loop should be: {{#exhibits}}...content...{{/exhibits}} all on one line

This will create:
- Each exhibit on its own line
- NO gaps between lines
- Clean, compact format

HOW TO FIX IN WORD:
1. Select the entire overage charges section
2. Delete it completely
3. Type the code above on ONE line (no Enter key, no line breaks)
4. Save the template

ALTERNATIVE (If you need line breaks but want to control spacing):

In Word, after pasting the template:
1. Select all the overage charge lines
2. Right-click → Paragraph
3. Set "Spacing Before" to 0pt
4. Set "Spacing After" to 0pt
5. Set "Line spacing" to Single
6. Click OK
