FINAL CLEAN TEMPLATE - Single Line Format (Like Second Image)

Copy this EXACT code into your Word template:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB
{{/exhibits}}

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Put "{{#exhibits}}" at the START of the line (no spaces before it)
2. Put everything on ONE line until "{{/exhibits}}"
3. Put "{{/exhibits}}" on a NEW line (this creates the line break between exhibits)
4. NO extra blank lines between the loop tags

This will create:
- Each exhibit on its own single line
- No extra spacing
- Clean format like: "Overage Charges for Slack To Teams: $22.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month | $1.50 per GB"

ALTERNATIVE (If per-GB should only show for Content):

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month{{#exhibitOveragePerGB}} | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibitOveragePerGB}}
{{/exhibits}}
