EXACT TEMPLATE CODE - Matches Second Screenshot Format

Copy this EXACT code into your Word template (all on ONE line):

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibits}}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Delete ALL existing overage charges code in your template
2. Type the code above EXACTLY as shown
3. Make sure it's ALL on ONE line (no Enter key, no line breaks)
4. NO spaces before {{#exhibits}} or after {{/exhibits}}
5. Save the template

ADDITIONAL FIX - Set Paragraph Formatting in Word:

After pasting the code:
1. Place cursor in the overage charges area
2. Right-click → Paragraph
3. Set these EXACT values:
   - Spacing Before: 0 pt
   - Spacing After: 0 pt  
   - Line spacing: Single (exactly)
   - Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style: CHECKED
4. Click OK
5. Save template

This will create the EXACT format from your second screenshot:
- Each exhibit on one clean line
- No gaps between lines
- Proper formatting: "Overage Charges for [Name]: $X.00 per User | $Y.00 per server per month | $Z.00 per GB"
