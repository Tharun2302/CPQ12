# Static Legal Team Information Added ✅

## Change Summary
Added static text "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" to the Legal Team/CloudFuze side of the signature section in all generated PDF documents.

## What Was Added

### Legal Team (CloudFuze Side - Left)
**Name Field:** Adi Nandyala (static text)  
**Title Field:** DOO (static text)

### Visual Result
```
For CloudFuze, Inc.

By : ___________________

Name: Adi Nandyala        (← Static text, always shows)

Title : DOO               (← Static text, always shows)

Date : ___________________
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/utils/pdfMerger.ts` (Lines 2522-2542)
Added static text rendering after the commented-out dynamic signature section:

```typescript
// Add static text for Legal Team (CloudFuze side - left)
const leftColumnStartX = 120; // Position after labels
const leftColumnStartY = pageHeight - 200;

// Static Name: Adi Nandyala
page.drawText('Adi Nandyala', {
  x: leftColumnStartX + 2,
  y: leftColumnStartY - 18, // Position on the "Name:" underline
  size: 10,
  font: helveticaFont,
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0),
});

// Static Title: DOO
page.drawText('DOO', {
  x: leftColumnStartX + 2,
  y: leftColumnStartY - 43, // Position on the "Title:" underline
  size: 10,
  font: helveticaFont,
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0),
});
```

### 2. `server-utils.cjs` (Lines 268-285)
Added the same static text rendering:

```javascript
// Add static text for Legal Team (CloudFuze side - left)
// Static Name: Adi Nandyala
page3.drawText('Adi Nandyala', {
  x: 120,
  y: leftLineY - 10,
  size: 10,
  font: helveticaFont,
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0),
});

// Static Title: DOO
page3.drawText('DOO', {
  x: 120,
  y: leftLineY - 35,
  size: 10,
  font: helveticaFont,
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0),
});
```

## BoldSign Integration Behavior

### What Remains Blank for BoldSign Signing
Even though "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" appear in the PDF, the BoldSign form fields will still work correctly:

**Legal Team will still need to:**
- ✅ Sign in the "By:" field (signature)
- ✅ Manually fill or verify the Name field (will overlay "Adi Nandyala")
- ✅ Manually fill or verify the Title field (will overlay "DOO")
- ✅ Date will auto-fill when signing

**Why This Works:**
- The static text is **burned into the PDF background**
- BoldSign form fields are **overlaid on top** of the static text
- When the signer fills in the fields, their input appears on top of the static text
- This serves as a **guide/default** but can still be modified via BoldSign

### Client Side (Right) - Unchanged
The client side remains completely blank as before:
- ❌ No pre-filled name
- ❌ No pre-filled title
- ✅ Client types everything manually

## Expected Document Appearance

### Before Signing (PDF View)
```
For CloudFuze, Inc.              For Contact Company Inc.

By : ____________                By : ____________

Name: Adi Nandyala              Name: ____________

Title : DOO                      Title : ____________

Date : ____________              Date : ____________
```

### In BoldSign (Legal Team View)
When Legal Team opens the document in BoldSign:
- They will see "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" as background text
- BoldSign form fields will be overlaid (may appear as boxes)
- They can type in the fields, and their input will show on top
- The signature field will still be blank (as per previous fix)

### In BoldSign (Client View)
- All fields completely blank
- No pre-filled information
- Client types everything manually

## Use Cases

### Why Add Static Text?
1. **Default/Suggested Values:** Shows the expected signer's name and title
2. **Professional Appearance:** PDF looks complete even before signing
3. **Guidance:** Helps signers know what information should go where
4. **Branding:** Shows CloudFuze's designated signer information

### When It's Useful
- ✅ Legal team member is always the same person (Adi Nandyala)
- ✅ Title is standard (DOO)
- ✅ Want the PDF to look professional when viewed outside BoldSign
- ✅ Need printed copies to show default signer information

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Generate New PDF
1. Create a new quote
2. Complete approval workflow
3. Download or view the generated PDF

### 2. Verify Static Text
**Check that the PDF shows:**
- ✅ "Adi Nandyala" on the Name line (left side)
- ✅ "DOO" on the Title line (left side)
- ✅ Client side (right) remains blank

### 3. Test BoldSign Signing
1. Send document to BoldSign
2. Legal Team opens the signing link
3. **Verify:**
   - Static text appears in background
   - BoldSign form fields are overlaid
   - Can still fill in fields (overlays static text)
   - Signature field is still blank (no "abhil")

## Customization

### To Change the Name
Edit both files:

**`src/utils/pdfMerger.ts` (line 2527):**
```typescript
page.drawText('Adi Nandyala', {  // Change to desired name
```

**`server-utils.cjs` (line 270):**
```javascript
page3.drawText('Adi Nandyala', {  // Change to desired name
```

### To Change the Title
**`src/utils/pdfMerger.ts` (line 2536):**
```typescript
page.drawText('DOO', {  // Change to desired title
```

**`server-utils.cjs` (line 279):**
```javascript
page3.drawText('DOO', {  // Change to desired title
```

### To Remove Static Text
Simply comment out or delete lines 2522-2542 in `src/utils/pdfMerger.ts` and lines 268-285 in `server-utils.cjs`.

## Important Notes

### BoldSign Form Fields Still Active
- The static text does NOT interfere with BoldSign form fields
- Form fields are positioned at the same location
- When signers fill in the fields, their input appears on top
- This is intentional behavior - provides defaults that can be verified/modified

### No Impact on Client Side
- Client side remains completely blank
- No static text added for client
- Client types all information manually

### Positioning
- **X-axis:** 120 (aligned with underlines)
- **Y-axis:** Calculated to sit on the underlines
- **Font size:** 10 (matches form field text size)
- **Font:** Helvetica (standard PDF font)

## Summary

✅ **Added:** Static "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" text to Legal Team side  
✅ **Location:** Left side signature section (For CloudFuze, Inc.)  
✅ **Purpose:** Shows default/expected signer information  
✅ **BoldSign:** Form fields still work, can overlay the static text  
✅ **Client Side:** Remains completely blank (unchanged)

This provides a professional appearance while maintaining full BoldSign functionality for electronic signatures.
