# BoldSign Blank Signature Fields - Complete Fix ✅

## Issue Summary
When users clicked on signature fields in BoldSign documents, the signature modal was pre-filling with names like "abhil" and "abhilasha" instead of being completely blank for manual entry.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Pre-filled PDF Content ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Signature data was being written directly into the PDF before sending to BoldSign.
- The PDF had text like "abhil", "abhilasha" burned into it
- BoldSign form fields were placed over this pre-filled text

**Solution:** Disabled signature data rendering in:
- `src/utils/pdfMerger.ts` (lines 2352-2520)
- `server-utils.cjs` (lines 227-266 and 351-390)

### 2. BoldSign Signer Name Auto-Fill ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** BoldSign was using the `Name` property from the Signer configuration to pre-fill the signature typing modal.
- When `Name: 'Legal Team'` or `Name: clientName` was set, BoldSign used these values
- The signature modal's "Your name" field was pre-populated with this name

**Solution:** Changed signer names to single space character to prevent auto-fill:
```javascript
{
  Name: ' ', // Single space prevents BoldSign from pre-filling
  EmailAddress: legalTeamEmail,
  SignerOrder: 1,
  FormFields: mapToBoldSignFields(legalTeamFields)
}
```

### 3. Form Field Configuration ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem:** Need to explicitly prevent any form field pre-filling.

**Solution:** Added explicit configuration to prevent pre-filling:
```javascript
// For Signature fields
if (f.fieldType === 'Signature') {
  mappedField.PrefillType = 'None';
}

// For TextBox fields (Name, Title)
if (f.fieldType === 'TextBox') {
  mappedField.Value = '';
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/utils/pdfMerger.ts`
**Lines 2352-2520:** Commented out signature data rendering
```typescript
// DISABLED: Pre-filling signature data (for BoldSign integration)
// Signature fields are now left blank for BoldSign to handle via form fields
/* ... all signature rendering code commented out ... */
```

### 2. `server-utils.cjs`
**Lines 227-266:** Commented out Legal Team signature rendering
**Lines 351-390:** Commented out Client signature rendering
```javascript
// DISABLED: Pre-filling signature data (for BoldSign integration)
/* ... signature rendering code commented out ... */
```

### 3. `server.cjs`
**First BoldSign endpoint (lines 3700-3736):**
- Enhanced `mapToBoldSignFields` function with `PrefillType: 'None'` for signatures
- Added `Value: ''` for TextBox fields
- Changed signer names from 'Legal Team' and clientName to single space

**Second BoldSign endpoint (lines 4347-4376):**
- Enhanced `mapToBoldSignFields` function with same prefill prevention
- Changed signer names to single space

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Legal Team Receives Email
1. Click "Sign Document" link in email
2. BoldSign opens the document
3. Click on "Sign Here" button for the "By:" signature field
4. **Signature modal opens with BLANK "Your name" field**
5. User manually types their name (e.g., "John Smith")
6. Selects signature style and clicks "Accept & use"

### When Client Receives Email
1. Same process as Legal Team
2. **All fields are completely blank**
3. Client manually types their name
4. Client manually fills in Name and Title fields
5. Date auto-fills when signed

### What You Should See
✅ **Signature Modal:**
- "Your name" field: BLANK (user must type)
- Signature style options: Only show after user types

✅ **PDF Document:**
- "By:" field: Blank underline (no pre-filled text)
- "Name:" field: Blank underline
- "Title:" field: Blank underline  
- "Date:" field: Blank (auto-fills on signing)

✅ **Both Sides:**
- Legal Team (left side): All blank
- Client (right side): All blank

### What You Should NOT See
❌ "abhil" or any other name pre-filled in signature modal
❌ "abhilasha" or any name in the client signature modal
❌ Any pre-filled text in the PDF document itself
❌ Any default values in Name or Title fields

## Testing Instructions

### Full Workflow Test
1. **Generate New Quote**
   - Create a new quote with all details
   - Complete the signature form (this won't appear in PDF anymore)
   - Submit for approval

2. **Complete Approval Workflow**
   - Get Manager approval
   - Get CEO approval
   - Get Client approval

3. **Test Legal Team Signature**
   - Open email sent to legal team
   - Click "Sign Document"
   - Click on "Sign Here" for the "By:" field
   - **VERIFY:** "Your name" field in modal is completely BLANK
   - Type a name and verify it works

4. **Test Client Signature**
   - Have client open their email
   - Click "Sign Document"
   - Click on "Sign Here" for the "By:" field
   - **VERIFY:** "Your name" field in modal is completely BLANK
   - **VERIFY:** Name and Title fields are also BLANK
   - Fill in manually and verify it works

## Technical Details

### Why Single Space for Signer Name?
- BoldSign requires a `Name` property for each signer
- Setting it to empty string `''` might cause validation errors
- Using single space `' '` satisfies the requirement while preventing auto-fill
- BoldSign trims whitespace, so it appears as blank in the UI

### PrefillType Property
- Set to `'None'` for Signature fields
- Explicitly tells BoldSign not to pre-fill the signature
- This is a defensive measure even though BoldSign doesn't support signature pre-fill by default

### Value Property for TextBox
- Explicitly set to empty string `''`
- Ensures no residual values are carried over
- Provides clean slate for manual entry

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

### Restore PDF Signature Rendering
1. Open `src/utils/pdfMerger.ts`
2. Find line 2352
3. Remove the `/*` and `*/` comment markers

### Restore Signer Names
1. Open `server.cjs`
2. Find line 3762: Change `Name: ' '` back to `Name: 'Legal Team'`
3. Find line 3768: Change `Name: ' '` back to `Name: clientName || 'Client'`
4. Repeat for second endpoint around lines 4438 and 4444

### Restore Simple Field Mapping
1. Remove the `PrefillType` and `Value` additions from `mapToBoldSignFields` functions
2. Restore original simple mapping structure

## Verification Checklist

After deploying this fix, verify:
- [ ] Legal Team signature modal "Your name" field is blank
- [ ] Client signature modal "Your name" field is blank
- [ ] PDF "By:" fields show no pre-filled text
- [ ] PDF "Name:" fields show no pre-filled text
- [ ] PDF "Title:" fields show no pre-filled text
- [ ] Users can manually type their signatures
- [ ] Users can manually fill Name and Title fields
- [ ] Date auto-fills correctly when document is signed
- [ ] Final signed document looks professional
- [ ] No error messages from BoldSign API

## Additional Notes

### BoldSign Behavior
- BoldSign does NOT support pre-filling of Signature fields by design
- However, it may suggest the signer's name from the `Name` property
- Using single space prevents this suggestion

### Why Multiple Fixes Were Needed
1. **PDF rendering fix:** Stopped text from being burned into PDF
2. **Signer name fix:** Stopped BoldSign from suggesting names
3. **Field configuration fix:** Added defensive measures to ensure blank fields

### All Three Fixes Together
- Ensures completely blank signature experience
- Provides professional, clean document for signing
- Allows signers to manually input their information
- Complies with e-signature best practices

## Support

If issues persist after this fix:
1. Check BoldSign account settings for any global pre-fill configurations
2. Verify signers don't have saved signatures in their BoldSign profiles
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Contact BoldSign support for account-specific issues

## Summary

This fix addresses signature pre-filling at **three levels**:
1. ✅ **PDF Content:** No text rendered into PDF
2. ✅ **BoldSign Configuration:** Signer names set to blank space
3. ✅ **Form Fields:** Explicit configuration to prevent pre-fill

**Result:** Completely blank signature fields ready for manual entry by both Legal Team and Client.
