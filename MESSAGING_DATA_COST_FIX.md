# ✅ Messaging Data Cost Fix - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**

For "Messaging" migration type, the data cost was being calculated and displayed, but it should be 0 since messaging migration doesn't involve data storage costs.

---

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

In `src/utils/pricing.ts`, the Messaging calculation logic was still calculating data costs:

**Before (Lines 157-158):**
```typescript
const dataPerGbRate = dataCostPerGB[planKey];
const dataCost = (config.dataSizeGB || 0) * dataPerGbRate;
```

This was calculating data costs even for Messaging migration type, which is incorrect.

---

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **File:** `src/utils/pricing.ts`

**Fixed Messaging Data Cost Calculation:**
```typescript
// For Messaging migration: data cost should be 0 (no data cost calculation)
const dataCost = 0;
```

**Removed:**
- `dataPerGbRate` calculation
- `dataCostPerGB` lookup for Messaging migration
- Data size multiplication

---
