SOLUTION: Template Code Not Fitting on One Line

OPTION 1: Disable Word Wrap (Recommended)
1. In Word, go to View tab
2. Uncheck "Word Wrap" or "Wrap Text" 
3. This will let you see the full line without wrapping
4. The template will still work correctly even if it wraps visually

OPTION 2: Use Non-Breaking Format
If Word keeps wrapping, you can break it but keep it functional:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibits}}

Just make sure:
- NO line breaks between {{#exhibits}} and {{/exhibits}}
- NO spaces before {{#exhibits}} or after {{/exhibits}}
- The entire loop is continuous (even if Word wraps it visually)

OPTION 3: Use Smaller Font in Template (Just for Editing)
1. Select the template code
2. Change font size to 8pt (just for editing visibility)
3. This helps see the full line
4. The generated document will use normal font size

OPTION 4: Copy-Paste from Here
Copy this exact code (it's all one line, even if it wraps here):

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibits}}

IMPORTANT: 
- Even if Word wraps it visually, as long as you don't press Enter, it's still one line
- The template processor will treat it as one line
- The generated document will format correctly
