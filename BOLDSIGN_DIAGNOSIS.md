# BoldSign Error Diagnosis ‚úÖ

## Test Results

‚úÖ **BoldSign API Key:** VALID and working!

## So Why the Error?

Since the API key is working, the error must be coming from **something else** in the workflow. Possible causes:

### 1. Document Not Found in MongoDB ‚ùå
- The workflow might reference a document that doesn't exist
- Document ID might be incorrect

### 2. Document Data Format Issue ‚ùå
- Document might not have valid base64 data
- PDF conversion might have failed

### 3. Invalid Email Addresses ‚ùå
- Legal team email might be invalid
- Client email might be invalid or missing

### 4. Form Field Configuration Issue ‚ùå
- BoldSign might reject the form field configuration
- Page number might be wrong (if PDF has fewer than 3 pages)

## How to Find the Real Issue

I've enhanced the server error logging. Now follow these steps:

### Step 1: Restart Your Server
The enhanced logging is now in the code, so restart to apply it:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Try Approving a Workflow Again
1. Go to your Manager or CEO approval dashboard
2. Try approving a workflow
3. When you get the error...

### Step 3: Check Server Console
Look at your server console (the terminal where server is running). You should now see detailed error information like:

```
‚ùå Error triggering BoldSign integration: [error]
‚ùå Error message: [specific message]
‚ùå BoldSign API Error Response:
   Status: [status code]
   Data: {
     "error": "...",
     "message": "..."
   }
```

### Step 4: Share the Error Details
Once you see the error in the server console:
1. Copy the full error message
2. Look for the specific error in the "Data" section
3. That will tell us exactly what's wrong

## Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Document not found"
**Cause:** DocumentId doesn't exist in MongoDB

**Fix:**
- The workflow might be old
- Try creating a fresh quote and workflow
- Make sure document is saved before approval

### Issue 2: "Invalid email address"
**Cause:** Email format is wrong

**Fix:** Check that emails are valid:
- Legal Team: Should be a real email (not 'legal@company.com')
- Client: Should be the actual client email

### Issue 3: "Invalid base64 data"
**Cause:** PDF data is corrupted

**Fix:**
- Regenerate the quote
- Make sure PDF generation succeeds

### Issue 4: "Page number out of range"
**Cause:** Form fields reference page 3, but PDF only has 1-2 pages

**Fix:**
- Check if the template generates 3 pages
- Verify PDF has signature section on page 3

## Browser Console Error Details

The browser will now also show detailed errors. Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab. You'll see:

```javascript
‚ùå BoldSign API Error: [detailed message]
‚ùå BoldSign Error Details: {
  // Full error object from BoldSign
}
```
