## 📊 Calculation Formula

### For Overage Agreement:

```javascript
Instance Cost = Number of Instances × Instance Type Cost × Duration

Where Instance Type Cost:
├── Small: $500 per month
├── Standard: $1,000 per month
├── Large: $2,000 per month
└── Extra Large: $3,500 per month

Total Cost = Instance Cost (ONLY)

All other costs = $0
```

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
- Instances: 1
- Type: Small ($500)
- Duration: 7 months
- **Total: $3,500** (1 × 500 × 7)

**Example 2:**
- Instances: 5
- Type: Standard ($1,000)
- Duration: 3 months
- **Total: $15,000** (5 × 1,000 × 3)

**Example 3:**
- Instances: 2
- Type: Large ($2,000)
- Duration: 6 months
- **Total: $24,000** (2 × 2,000 × 6)
