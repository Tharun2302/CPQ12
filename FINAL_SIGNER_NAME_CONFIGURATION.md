# Final Signer Name Configuration âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### Legal Team (Fixed Name)
- **Signer Name:** `"Adi Nandyala"` (always)
- **Why:** Legal team signer is always the same person
- **Result:** BoldSign signature modal will show "Adi Nandyala" for legal team

### Client (Extracted from Email)
- **Signer Name:** Extracted from client's email address
- **Why:** Personalizes the experience for each client
- **Result:** BoldSign signature modal will show the client's name extracted from email

---

## How Name Extraction Works

The system automatically converts email addresses to proper names:

### Examples:

| Client Email | Extracted Name |
|--------------|----------------|
| `john.smith@company.com` | John Smith |
| `abhilasha.kumar@example.com` | Abhilasha Kumar |
| `jane_doe@email.com` | Jane Doe |
| `bob-jones@domain.com` | Bob Jones |
| `maria@example.com` | Maria |

### Logic:
1. Extract username from email (part before @)
2. Replace dots (.), underscores (_), and hyphens (-) with spaces
3. Capitalize each word
4. Join with spaces

**Code:**
```javascript
const extractNameFromEmail = (email) => {
  if (!email) return 'Client';
  const username = email.split('@')[0];
  return username
    .replace(/[._-]/g, ' ')
    .split(' ')
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
    .join(' ');
};
```

## What Users Will See

### Legal Team Experience

**BoldSign Email:** "Adi Nandyala, please sign this document"

**Signature Modal:**
- "Your name" field: **Adi Nandyala** (pre-filled)
- Can clear and change if needed
- But typically will use "Adi Nandyala"

**PDF Document:**
- Name field shows: **Adi Nandyala** (static text in PDF)
- Title field shows: **DOO** (static text in PDF)
- BoldSign form fields overlay these

### Client Experience

**BoldSign Email:** "[Client Name], please sign this document"

**Signature Modal:**
- "Your name" field: **Extracted Name** (e.g., "Abhilasha Kumar")
- Can clear and change if needed
- More personalized than generic "Client"

**PDF Document:**
- Name field: **Blank** (no static text)
- Title field: **Blank** (no static text)
- Client types their information

---

## Two Endpoints Updated

### 1. `/api/boldsign/send-document` (Lines 3777-3787)
```javascript
Signers: [
  {
    Name: 'Adi Nandyala', // Fixed for Legal Team
    EmailAddress: legalTeamEmail,
    SignerOrder: 1,
    FormFields: mapToBoldSignFields(legalTeamFields)
  },
  {
    Name: clientSignerName, // Extracted from email
    EmailAddress: clientEmail,
    SignerOrder: 2,
    FormFields: mapToBoldSignFields(clientFields)
  }
]
```

### 2. `/api/trigger-boldsign` (Lines 4472-4482)
Same configuration as above.

## Important Notes

### The Signer Name vs Form Fields

**Don't confuse these two:**

1. **Signer Name** (what we just configured)
   - Used by BoldSign for system identification
   - Shows in emails, notifications
   - Pre-fills the signature typing modal "Your name" field
   - **This is what we control in the API**

2. **PDF Form Fields** (the actual signature section)
   - The Name, Title, Date fields on the PDF
   - These remain as configured:
     - Legal Team: Static "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" in PDF
     - Client: Blank (user types)
   - **Independent of Signer Name**

### Users Can Always Edit

Even though we pre-fill the "Your name" field in the signature modal:
- âœ… Users can clear it
- âœ… Users can type a different name
- âœ… It's a suggestion, not locked

---

## Testing the Configuration

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Create Test Workflow

**Test with different email formats:**
- `john.smith@company.com` â†’ Should show "John Smith"
- `single@email.com` â†’ Should show "Single"
- `first_last@domain.com` â†’ Should show "First Last"

### Step 3: Approve Workflow
- Go to Manager or CEO approval
- Approve the workflow
- Should succeed âœ…

### Step 4: Check BoldSign Emails

**Legal Team Email:**
- Should be addressed to "Adi Nandyala"
- Signature modal shows "Adi Nandyala"

**Client Email:**
- Should be addressed to extracted name
- Signature modal shows extracted name

### Step 5: Test Signing
- Open both signing links
- Verify names are pre-filled as expected
- Verify users can edit the names

## Fallback Behavior

If things are missing, the system falls back gracefully:

| Missing Data | Fallback Value |
|--------------|----------------|
| Client email | `'Client'` |
| Client name (and can't extract) | `'Client'` |
| Legal team email | Uses configured legal email |

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Legal Team
âœ… Always shows the correct signer name (Adi Nandyala)  
âœ… Consistent across all documents  
âœ… Professional appearance  
âœ… Matches the static text in PDF  

### For Clients
âœ… Personalized experience (sees their name)  
âœ… Better than generic "Client" or "Signer"  
âœ… Professional and polished  
âœ… Can edit if extraction is wrong  

### For System
âœ… No manual name entry needed  
âœ… Automatic extraction from email  
âœ… Graceful fallbacks  
âœ… Complies with BoldSign requirements

## Examples in Action

### Example 1: Standard Client

**Input:**
- Client Email: `abhilasha@contactcompany.com`
- Client Name: Not provided

**BoldSign Will Show:**
- Legal Team: "Adi Nandyala"
- Client: "Abhilasha"

### Example 2: Client with Full Name in Email

**Input:**
- Client Email: `john.smith@acmecorp.com`
- Client Name: Not provided

**BoldSign Will Show:**
- Legal Team: "Adi Nandyala"
- Client: "John Smith"

### Example 3: Client Name Provided

**Input:**
- Client Email: `ceo@bigcompany.com`
- Client Name: "Robert Johnson"

**BoldSign Will Show:**
- Legal Team: "Adi Nandyala"
- Client: "Robert Johnson" (uses provided name, not extracted)

---

## Summary

âœ… **Legal Team:** Fixed name "Adi Nandyala" for all documents  
âœ… **Client:** Smart extraction from email address  
âœ… **Fallback:** Uses provided client name if available  
âœ… **User Control:** All names can be edited during signing  
âœ… **Professional:** Personalized experience for each signer  

**The configuration is complete and ready to use!** ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

1. **Restart server** to apply changes
2. **Test with real email addresses** to see name extraction
3. **Verify BoldSign emails** show correct names
4. **Test signing process** to ensure everything works

The system is now configured for optimal user experience! âœ¨
