FIXED TEMPLATE CODE - Each Exhibit on New Line

Use this EXACT code in your Word template:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB
{{/exhibits}}

KEY DIFFERENCE:
- Put {{/exhibits}} on a NEW LINE (press Enter after the per GB part)
- This creates a line break between each exhibit
- Each exhibit will start on its own line

RESULT:
Overage Charges for Dropbox To Azureblob: $30.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month | $1.00 per GB
Overage Charges for Dropbox To Box: $30.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month | $1.00 per GB
Overage Charges for Onedrive To Onedrive: $30.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month | $1.00 per GB

Each line starts fresh with "Overage Charges for" - no continuation from previous line.
