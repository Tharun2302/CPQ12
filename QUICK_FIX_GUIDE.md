- Try refreshing the page after starting the server

### **Issue: Still seeing demo data**
**Solution:**
- Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running
- Click "Connect to HubSpot" again
- Check browser console for any error messages

### **Issue: "Connection timeout"**
**Solution:**
- The server might be starting slowly
- Wait 10-15 seconds after starting the server

## 🧪 **Test Everything**

Run this command to verify your setup:
```bash
cd project
node test-hubspot.cjs
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

If you're still having issues:
1. Check that both servers are running
2. Look for error messages in the terminal windows
3. Check the browser console for any errors
