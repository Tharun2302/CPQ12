CLEAN TEMPLATE CODE (No Extra Spaces)

Copy this into your Word template:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month{{#exhibitOveragePerGB}} | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibitOveragePerGB}}{{/exhibits}}

IMPORTANT: 
- Put everything on ONE line (no line breaks)
- This will create one bullet point per exhibit with no extra spacing
- Each exhibit will appear on its own line automatically

ALTERNATIVE (If you want each exhibit on a separate line with proper spacing):

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month{{#exhibitOveragePerGB}} | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibitOveragePerGB}}
{{/exhibits}}

This version:
- Keeps exhibits on separate lines
- Removes extra blank lines between them
- Maintains clean formatting
