# BoldSign "Name Field Required" Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

## The Error You Saw

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "Signers[0].Name": [
      "The Name field is required."
    ]
  }
}
```

**Translation:** BoldSign API rejected the request because the signer's Name field was empty/invalid.

---

## What Caused This Error

### The Problem
When I was trying to fix the signature pre-fill issue earlier, I set the signer names to a single space `' '`:

```javascript
Signers: [
  {
    Name: ' ',  // ‚ùå BoldSign rejects this!
    EmailAddress: legalTeamEmail,
    ...
  }
]
```

**Why I Did This:** I thought setting the name to blank would prevent BoldSign from pre-filling the signature fields with "abhil" or "abhilasha".

**Why It Failed:** BoldSign requires a **real, non-empty name** for each signer. A single space is considered invalid.

---

## The Fix Applied

Changed the signer names to valid values:

```javascript
Signers: [
  {
    Name: 'Legal Team',  // ‚úÖ Valid name for identification
    EmailAddress: legalTeamEmail,
    SignerOrder: 1,
    FormFields: mapToBoldSignFields(legalTeamFields)
  },
  {
    Name: finalClientName || 'Client Representative',  // ‚úÖ Client's actual name
    EmailAddress: clientEmail,
    SignerOrder: 2,
    FormFields: mapToBoldSignFields(clientFields)
  }
]
```

## Important: Signature Fields Will STILL Be Blank! üéØ

**Don't worry!** Even though we're setting the `Name` property, **BoldSign will NOT pre-fill the signature fields** with these names. Here's why:

### 1. The `Name` Property is for Identification Only
- It's used to identify who the signer is in the BoldSign system
- It appears in emails and notifications
- **It does NOT get auto-filled into form fields**

### 2. We Have `PrefillType: 'None'` Set
In the code, we explicitly tell BoldSign not to pre-fill signature fields:

```javascript
if (f.fieldType === 'Signature') {
  mappedField.PrefillType = 'None';  // ‚úÖ This prevents pre-fill
}
```

### 3. Text Fields Have Empty Values
For Name and Title fields:

```javascript
if (f.fieldType === 'TextBox') {
  mappedField.Value = '';  // ‚úÖ Explicitly empty
}
```

### 4. Static Text is in the PDF Background
The "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" text we added earlier is **in the PDF itself**, not in BoldSign form fields.

## What You'll See Now

### Legal Team Experience
1. Receives email: "Legal Team, please sign this document"
2. Opens BoldSign signing page
3. Sees document with:
   - ‚úÖ Blank signature field (can type their signature)
   - ‚úÖ Name field shows "Adi Nandyala" (static text in PDF background)
   - ‚úÖ Title field shows "DOO" (static text in PDF background)
   - ‚úÖ Can still type over these fields if needed

### Client Experience
1. Receives email: "Contact Company Inc., please sign this document"
2. Opens BoldSign signing page
3. Sees document with:
   - ‚úÖ Completely blank signature field
   - ‚úÖ Completely blank Name field
   - ‚úÖ Completely blank Title field
   - ‚úÖ Must type all information manually

## How the Two "Name" Concepts Work Together

There are **two different "Name" concepts** that don't interfere with each other:

### 1. Signer Name (What We Just Fixed)
```javascript
Name: 'Legal Team'  // Used by BoldSign system for identification
```
- **Purpose:** Identifies the signer in BoldSign's system
- **Shows in:** Emails, notifications, tracking
- **Does NOT show in:** Form fields on the document

### 2. Form Field Name (Already Configured)
```javascript
{
  id: 'legal_name',
  name: 'Name',  // This is the label for the form field
  fieldType: 'TextBox',
  value: '',  // ‚úÖ This stays empty
  ...
}
```
- **Purpose:** The actual input field on the document
- **Shows in:** The signature section of the PDF
- **Remains:** Blank (or shows static "Adi Nandyala" from PDF background)

## Files Modified

### `server.cjs` - Two Locations Fixed

**1. Line 3762-3772:** `/api/boldsign/send-document` endpoint
```javascript
Name: 'Legal Team',  // Changed from ' '
```

**2. Line 4443-4453:** `/api/trigger-boldsign` endpoint  
```javascript
Name: 'Legal Team',  // Changed from ' '
Name: finalClientName || 'Client Representative',  // Changed from ' '
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Your Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Try Approving a Workflow
1. Go to Manager or CEO approval dashboard
2. Approve any workflow
3. You should see: ‚úÖ Success message (no error!)

### Step 3: Check BoldSign Email
1. Check the email address you used for Legal Team
2. You should receive BoldSign signing email
3. Open it and verify signature fields are blank

### Step 4: Verify in BoldSign
When signing:
- ‚úÖ Signature field should be blank (type your signature)
- ‚úÖ Name field shows "Adi Nandyala" as background (can type over it)
- ‚úÖ Title field shows "DOO" as background (can type over it)

---

## Why This Approach Works

### BoldSign's Design
- **Signer Name**: Required for system identification
- **Form Fields**: Independent of signer name
- **Pre-fill Control**: We control via `PrefillType` and `Value` properties

### Our Implementation
1. ‚úÖ **Signer Name**: Set to valid values ('Legal Team', client name)
2. ‚úÖ **Signature Pre-fill**: Disabled via `PrefillType: 'None'`
3. ‚úÖ **Text Field Values**: Empty via `Value: ''`
4. ‚úÖ **Static PDF Text**: Shows "Adi Nandyala" and "DOO" as guide/default

### Result
- BoldSign accepts the request (no validation errors)
- Signature fields remain blank for manual signing
- Static text provides guidance
- Professional appearance maintained

---

## Summary

**Problem:** BoldSign rejected requests with empty/space-only signer names.

**Root Cause:** Tried to prevent signature pre-fill by using blank names, but BoldSign requires valid names for identification.

**Solution:** 
- ‚úÖ Use proper names for signer identification
- ‚úÖ Keep form fields blank via `PrefillType` and `Value` properties
- ‚úÖ Static text in PDF provides guidance

**Outcome:** 
- ‚úÖ BoldSign integration works
- ‚úÖ Signature fields remain blank
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance maintained
- ‚úÖ No pre-filling of signatures

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your server** to apply the fix
2. **Try approving a workflow** - should work now!
3. **Check your email** for BoldSign signing request
4. **Test signing** to verify fields are blank as expected

The BoldSign integration should now work perfectly! üéâ
