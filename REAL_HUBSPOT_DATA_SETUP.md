# ðŸš€ Real HubSpot Data Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal: Get Real HubSpot Data Instead of Demo Data**

Your HubSpot API key is working perfectly and you have real data available. The issue is that the backend server needs to be running to connect to HubSpot.

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Start the Backend Server**

**Option A: Using the Easy Setup Script**
1. Double-click `start-hubspot-integration.bat`
2. Keep the window open (don't close it!)
3. You should see: "ðŸš€ CPQ Pro server running on port 4000"

**Option B: Manual Setup**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd path\to\project`
3. Run: `node server.cjs`
4. Keep the terminal window open

### **Step 2: Start the Frontend**

**Option A: Using the Easy Setup Script**
1. Open a NEW Command Prompt or PowerShell window
2. Double-click `start-frontend.bat`
3. Keep this window open too

**Option B: Manual Setup**
1. Open a NEW Command Prompt or PowerShell window
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd path\to\project`
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Keep the terminal window open

### **Step 3: Access the Application**

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Navigate to the HubSpot Integration section
4. Click "Connect to HubSpot"

## âœ… **Expected Results**

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

- âœ… **"Connected to HubSpot"** status (not "Demo Mode")
- âœ… **Real contact data** (like "Damarys Blanco" with ID 5451)
- âœ… **Real deal data** from your HubSpot account
- âœ… **No more demo data** (no more "contact_1", "deal_1" IDs)

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Backend server is not available"**
**Solution:**
- Make sure you ran `node server.cjs` and kept the terminal open
- Check that you see "ðŸš€ CPQ Pro server running on port 4000"
- Try refreshing the page after starting the server

### **Issue: Still seeing demo data**
**Solution:**
- Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running
- Click "Connect to HubSpot" again
- Check the browser console for any error messages

### **Issue: "HubSpot API error"**
**Solution:**
- Your API key is working (we confirmed this)
- The issue is likely the backend server not running
- Start the backend server first, then try again

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Your Setup**

Run this command to test everything:
```bash
node test-hubspot.cjs
```

You should see:
- âœ… HubSpot API Connection Successful
- âœ… Found real contacts in HubSpot account
- âœ… Backend server is running
- âœ… Backend HubSpot test successful

## ðŸ“Š **What Real Data Looks Like**

**Real HubSpot Data:**
- Contact ID: `5451` (real number)
- Email: `blancod@ohsu.edu` (real email)
- Name: `Damarys Blanco` (real person)

**Demo Data (what you're seeing now):**
- Contact ID: `contact_1` (fake ID)
- Email: `john.doe@example.com` (fake email)
- Name: `John Doe` (fake name)

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success Indicators**

When you have real data working:
1. âœ… Backend server shows "Server is ready to handle requests"
2. âœ… Frontend shows "Connected to HubSpot" (not "Demo Mode")
3. âœ… You see real contact names and email addresses
4. âœ… Contact IDs are real numbers (not "contact_1", "contact_2")
5. âœ… You can create real contacts and deals in HubSpot

## ðŸš¨ **Important Notes**

1. **Keep both terminal windows open** - Don't close them!
2. **Backend server must run first** - Start it before the frontend
3. **Your HubSpot API key is working** - We confirmed real data is available
4. **The issue is just the server not running** - Once started, you'll get real data

## ðŸ“ž **Need Help?**

If you're still having issues:
1. Check that both servers are running
2. Look for error messages in the terminal windows
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Try the test script: `node test-hubspot.cjs`

**Remember:** Your HubSpot integration is working perfectly - you just need to keep the backend server running to access the real data!
