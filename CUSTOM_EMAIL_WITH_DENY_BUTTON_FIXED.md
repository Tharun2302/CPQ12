# Custom Email with Deny Button - FIXED ✅

## What Was Wrong

The `/api/trigger-boldsign` endpoint (called by Manager approval) was **missing the SendGrid custom email code**. It was only sending BoldSign's standard email, which doesn't have the Deny button.

## What I Fixed

Added custom SendGrid email sending to `/api/trigger-boldsign` endpoint (Lines 4527-4669).

## 📧 Now Legal Team Will Receive TWO Emails

### Email 1: From Your System ✅ **NEW - NOW INCLUDES DENY BUTTON!**

**From:** `saitharunreddy2302@gmail.com`  
**Subject:** "Action Required: Sign Agreement - [Client Name]"

**Buttons:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐
│ 📝 Review and Sign  │   │ ❌ Decline with      │
│   (BLUE)            │   │    Reason (RED)      │
└─────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘
```

**Blue Button:** Opens BoldSign signing page directly  
**Red Button:** Opens deny form (asks for reason, notifies everyone)

---

### Email 2: From BoldSign ✅ (Standard BoldSign Email)

**From:** `notification@mail.boldsign.com`  
**Subject:** "CloudFuze via BoldSign"

**Buttons:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Review and Sign     │
│   (BLUE)            │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 What Happens When Deny Button is Clicked

### Complete Flow:

**Step 1:** Legal Team clicks **"Decline with Reason"** (Red button in Email 1)

**Step 2:** Opens deny form page with fields:
```
Signer Name: Legal Team (pre-filled)
Signer Email: legal@company.com (pre-filled)
Reason: [Must type explanation]
```

**Step 3:** Legal Team types reason:
```
Example: "Contract pricing needs revision for migration costs"
```

**Step 4:** System processes:
```
✅ Saves denial to MongoDB workflow
✅ Updates workflow status to 'signature_denied'
✅ Revokes BoldSign document (cancels signing)
✅ Sends notification emails to EVERYONE
```

**Step 5:** Notification emails sent to:
```
✅ Technical Team → Notified with reason
✅ Legal Team → Confirmation email
✅ Client → Notified with reason
✅ Deal Desk → Notified (if in workflow)
```

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Signature Denied: PDF Agreement - John Smith

Legal Team has declined to sign the document.

Document Details:
• Document: PDF Agreement
• Client: John Smith
• Denied By: Legal Team (legal@company.com)
• Date: [timestamp]

Reason for Denial:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Contract pricing needs revision for      │
│ migration costs                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

The workflow has been stopped and marked as Signature Denied.
Please review the reason and take appropriate action.
```

## 📊 Before vs After This Fix

### Before (What You Experienced):

| Email Source | Has Deny Button? |
|--------------|------------------|
| Your System | ❌ NO - Email not sent |

---

### After (Now):

## 🔍 Server Console Verification

When you approve a workflow, watch the server console. You should see:

```
🎯 Triggering BoldSign integration...
📄 Fetching document from MongoDB...
✅ Document found: [filename]
🚀 Sending request to BoldSign API...
✅ BoldSign: Document sent successfully
  Document ID: [boldsign-doc-id]
✅ BoldSign document ID stored in workflow
✅ Custom signature request emails sent with Deny button to Legal Team and Client
```

**Key line to look for:**
```
✅ Custom signature request emails sent with Deny button to Legal Team and Client
```

If you see this → Custom emails were sent! ✅

If you see error → Check SendGrid configuration

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### If You Still Don't Receive Custom Email:

**Check server console for:**
```
✅ Custom signature request emails sent with Deny button to Legal Team and Client
```

**If you see error instead:**
```
⚠️ Could not send custom signature emails: [error message]
```

**Common causes:**
- SendGrid sender email not verified
- API key invalid
- Server not restarted

**Check SendGrid Activity:**
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
- See if email was sent
- Check delivery status
