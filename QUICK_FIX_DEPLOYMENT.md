# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for "Not Found" Error

## ðŸš¨ **The Problem**
Your Microsoft authentication callback is showing "Not Found" because:
1. You're only deploying the backend server
2. The frontend React app is not being built
3. The `dist` folder doesn't exist

## âœ… **The Solution**

### **Step 1: Update Your Render Build Command**

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your web service**
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Update Build Command**:
   ```
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
5. **Keep Start Command**:
   ```
   node server.cjs
   ```

### **Step 2: Redeploy**

1. **Click "Manual Deploy"** â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
2. **Wait for deployment** (3-5 minutes)
3. **Test your app**

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed in Your Code**

### **1. Updated server.cjs**
Added static file serving:
```javascript
// Serve static files from the React app build
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));
```

### **2. Updated Deployment Guide**
Changed build command to include frontend build:
```
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

1. **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates the `dist` folder with your React app
2. **Server**: Serves static files from `dist` folder
3. **Routes**: All routes (including `/auth/microsoft/callback`) serve the React app
4. **React Router**: Handles client-side routing

## âœ… **After Redeployment**

Your Microsoft authentication will work because:
- âœ… Frontend is built and served
- âœ… `/auth/microsoft/callback` route exists
- âœ… React Router handles the callback
- âœ… MicrosoftCallback component processes the auth code

## ðŸ§ª **Test Steps**

1. **Redeploy your app** with the new build command
2. **Go to your production URL**
3. **Click "Sign in with Microsoft"**
4. **Complete Microsoft authentication**
5. **Should redirect back successfully!**

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Result**

- âœ… Microsoft login popup opens
- âœ… User authenticates with Microsoft
- âœ… Redirects to: `https://cpq-101.onrender.com/auth/microsoft/callback`
- âœ… Shows "Authenticating with Microsoft..." page
- âœ… User is logged in successfully

Your Microsoft authentication will work perfectly after this fix! ðŸš€
