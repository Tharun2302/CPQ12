FINAL FIXED TEMPLATE CODE - Conditional Per-GB Display

Use this EXACT code in your Word template:

{{#exhibits}}Overage Charges for {{exhibitCombinationName}}: {{exhibitOveragePerUser}} per User | {{exhibitOveragePerServer}} per server per month{{#exhibitOveragePerGB}} | {{exhibitOveragePerGB}} per GB{{/exhibitOveragePerGB}}
{{/exhibits}}

KEY CHANGES:
1. Put {{/exhibits}} on a NEW LINE (press Enter after the closing conditional)
2. Use conditional {{#exhibitOveragePerGB}}...{{/exhibitOveragePerGB}} to only show per-GB when it exists
3. This ensures per-GB only shows for Content migrations, not Messaging/Email

RESULT:
- Content migrations: "Overage Charges for Dropbox To Azureblob: $35.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month | $1.50 per GB"
- Messaging/Email: "Overage Charges for Slack To Teams: $35.00 per User | $500.00 per server per month" (no per-GB)

FORMATTING IN WORD:
1. Select the overage charges area
2. Right-click → Paragraph
3. Set: Spacing Before: 0 pt, Spacing After: 0 pt, Line spacing: Single
4. Check: "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style"
5. Save template
