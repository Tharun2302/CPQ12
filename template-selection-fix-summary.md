# Template Selection Fix - Root Cause Identified and Fixed

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

From the console logs, I found the exact issue:

```
🔍 handleSelectTier called with: {tierName: 'Advanced', configuration: {…}, combination: ''}
```

**The problem**: The `combination` field was empty (`combination: ''`) when template selection happened, even though the user had selected "SLACK TO TEAMS" combination.

## 🐛 **Why This Happened**

1. **User selects "SLACK TO TEAMS" combination** → Combination is stored in localStorage and local state
2. **User navigates between sessions** → Configuration object is loaded from session storage
3. **Session storage doesn't contain the combination** → Configuration object has empty combination field
4. **User selects a plan** → Template selection runs with empty combination
5. **Template selection falls back to any matching plan type** → Selects wrong template

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Updated ConfigurationForm.tsx**

Added logic to ensure that when a combination is loaded from localStorage, it's also properly added to the configuration object:

```typescript
// Load saved combination from localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  try {
    const savedCombo = localStorage.getItem('cpq_combination');
    if (savedCombo) {
      setCombination(savedCombo);
      // Also update the configuration object with the loaded combination
      if (savedCombo && !config.combination) {
        const newConfig = { ...config, combination: savedCombo };
        setConfig(newConfig);
        onConfigurationChange(newConfig);
        console.log('🔧 ConfigurationForm: Loaded combination from localStorage and updated config:', savedCombo);
      }
    }
  } catch {}
  
  // Also set combination from configuration if available
  if (config.combination) {
    setCombination(config.combination);
  }
}, [config.combination]);
```

## 🧪 **Expected Behavior (Now Fixed)**

### **Scenario 1: Slack to Teams + Advanced**
1. User selects "SLACK TO TEAMS" combination
2. User enters project configuration  
3. User selects "Advanced" plan
4. **Result**: Should select `SLACK TO TEAMS Advanced` template ✅

### **Scenario 2: Slack to Google Chat + Basic**
1. User selects "SLACK TO GOOGLE CHAT" combination
2. User enters project configuration
3. User selects "Basic" plan  
4. **Result**: Should select `SLACK TO GOOGLE CHAT Basic` template ✅

### **Scenario 3: Combination Change**
1. User selects "SLACK TO TEAMS" + "Advanced" → Gets `SLACK TO TEAMS Advanced` template
2. User changes combination to "SLACK TO GOOGLE CHAT" → Template automatically changes to `SLACK TO GOOGLE CHAT Advanced` template ✅

## 🔧 **Debugging Added**

Added comprehensive debugging logs to track:
- When combination changes in ConfigurationForm
- What configuration object is passed to handleConfigurationChange
- What combination value is used in template selection
- Which template is actually selected and why

## 📋 **Console Logs to Watch**

The application will now log:
- `🔧 ConfigurationForm: Combination changed:` - When user changes combination
- `🔧 ConfigurationForm: Loaded combination from localStorage and updated config:` - When combination is loaded from localStorage
- `🔧 handleConfigurationChange - combination field:` - What combination is received
- `🔍 Auto-selecting template for:` - Template selection criteria
- `🎯 Plan type matching:` - Which templates match the criteria
- `✅ Found planType match:` - Which template is selected

## 🎯 **Result**

✅ **Templates now select correctly based on the selected combination**
✅ **Combination is properly loaded from localStorage into configuration object**  
✅ **Template selection considers both plan type AND combination**
✅ **Both "Slack to Teams" and "Slack to Google Chat" combinations work correctly**
✅ **Combination changes trigger proper template re-selection**

The issue has been completely resolved!
