# Overage Agreement First Load Fix

## 🎯 Critical Issue Fixed

### **Problem:**
When user **freshly comes to the application** and:
1. Selects Migration Type (Content or Messaging)
2. Selects Combination: **OVERAGE AGREEMENT**
3. Fills in: Instance Type, Number of Instances, Duration
4. Clicks **Calculate Pricing**

→ **Nothing happens! No pricing display appears** ❌

But if they select another combination first (like DROPBOX TO SHAREDRIVE), then switch back to overage agreement, it works ✅

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Line 1035 in `src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
// WRONG - This validation fails for overage agreement
const hasCoreConfig = configuration.migrationType && configuration.numberOfUsers > 0;

if (hasCoreConfig) {
  // Calculate and show pricing ✅
} else {
  // Hide pricing, reset everything ❌
  setShowPricing(false);
  setSelectedTier(null);
  setCalculations([]);
}
```

### Why It Failed:
1. **Overage Agreement hides "Number of Users" field** (in `ConfigurationForm.tsx` line 938-961)
   ```typescript
   {config.combination !== 'overage-agreement' && (
     <div className="group">
       <label>Number of Users</label>
       <input type="number" value={config.numberOfUsers} />
     </div>
   )}
   ```

2. **Since the field is hidden, `numberOfUsers` stays at 0**

3. **Validation check fails:**
   ```typescript
   configuration.numberOfUsers > 0  // → false (it's 0!)
   ```

4. **Pricing is reset and hidden instead of calculated**

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Validation Logic (Line 1035-1039)
**Updated `src/App.tsx`:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const hasCoreConfig = configuration.migrationType && configuration.numberOfUsers > 0;

// AFTER (FIXED):
const hasCoreConfig = configuration.migrationType && (
  configuration.numberOfUsers > 0 || 
  configuration.combination === 'overage-agreement'  // ← Allow overage with 0 users
);
```

### Fix #2: Template Auto-Selection (Lines 1117-1146)
**Added PRIORITY 0 check for overage agreement:**
```typescript
// NEW - Special handling for OVERAGE AGREEMENT (runs BEFORE other checks)
if (combination === 'overage-agreement') {
  console.log('🎯 OVERAGE AGREEMENT detected - using special matching logic');
  
  const overageMatches = templates.filter(t => {
    const templateCombination = (t?.combination || '').toLowerCase();
    const templateCategory = (t?.category || '').toLowerCase();
    const matchesCombination = templateCombination === 'overage-agreement';
    const matchesCategory = templateCategory === migration; // 'content' or 'messaging'
    
    return matchesCombination && matchesCategory;
  });
  
  if (overageMatches.length > 0) {
    return overageMatches[0]; // Returns "OVERAGE AGREEMENT Content" or "OVERAGE AGREEMENT Messaging"
  }
}
```

**Why This Was Needed:**
- Overage agreement templates have `planType: 'overage'` (not basic/standard/advanced)
- Regular matching logic looks for `planType === 'basic'/'standard'/'advanced'`
- This causes mismatch, selecting wrong templates
- Special handler bypasses planType check and matches by `combination` + `category`

### Logic Flow Now:
```
Is migration type selected?
├─ YES
│  └─ Is numberOfUsers > 0?
│     ├─ YES → ✅ Show pricing
│     └─ NO → Is combination overage-agreement?
│        ├─ YES → ✅ Show pricing (FIXED!)
│        └─ NO → ❌ Hide pricing
└─ NO → ❌ Hide pricing
```

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### Test Case: Fresh Load → Overage Agreement (MUST WORK NOW!)

**Steps:**
1. Open app in incognito/fresh browser (or clear localStorage)
2. Select Migration Type: **Content**
3. Select Combination: **OVERAGE AGREEMENT**
4. Fill in:
   - Instance Type: Large
   - Number of Instances: 8
   - Duration: 5 months
5. Click **Calculate Pricing**

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Pricing section appears immediately
✅ Shows "Overage Agreement Pricing" title
✅ Shows ONE plan box:
   - Title: "Overage Agreement"
   - Price: $80,000.00 (2000 × 5 × 8)
   - Instance details shown
   - Purple "Select Overage Agreement" button
```

**Calculation:**
```
Instance Type: Large = $2,000/month
Duration: 5 months
Instances: 8
Total = $2,000 × 5 × 8 = $80,000.00 ✅
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Broken):
```
User Flow:
1. Fresh app load
2. Select "OVERAGE AGREEMENT"
3. Fill configuration
4. Click "Calculate Pricing"
   ↓
❌ Nothing happens
❌ numberOfUsers = 0 fails validation
❌ Pricing hidden
```

### AFTER (Fixed):
```
User Flow:
1. Fresh app load
2. Select "OVERAGE AGREEMENT"
3. Fill configuration
4. Click "Calculate Pricing"
   ↓
✅ Pricing calculated (numberOfUsers = 0 allowed for overage)
✅ Shows overage agreement plan box
✅ Total = $80,000 displayed
```
